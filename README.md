- 👋 Hi, I’m @trivial-proofs 
- 🖊 This is going to be mostly a math blog, or more realistically a public collection of notes. My goal isn't really to be interesting, but to be useful. I have a pretty crappy memory and don't like thinking, so I often google  up the answers to questions that I really should know the answer to or be able to solve on my own, given that I have like 80% of a PhD in math. Often google fails me, possibly because serious mathematicians don't feel like these things are worth writing up. My goal with this blog is to post the answers I eventually find, rather than writing them down in a notebook and then loosing the notebook and then having the same question in a few months. 
- 📫 You can email me at weirdthoughtsssss@gmail.com. I don't really want to associate this account to my academic persona, and I don't feel like making another burner email, so instead I'm associating it with the finsta where I posted some abstract architecture photos I took I was high. You can DM me there too I guess but I may not ever respond: https://www.instagram.com/w_h_e_e_e_e/.
